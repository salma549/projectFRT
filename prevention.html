    <h1>COVID-19 Prevention Methods</h1>
    
    <h2>Wash Your Hands</h2>
    <p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</p>
    
    <h2>Wear a Mask</h2>
    <p>Wear a mask in public settings and around others who don’t live in your household, especially when social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Make sure your mask covers your nose and mouth.</p>
    
    <h2>Social Distancing</h2>
    <p>Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from others who don’t live with you, both indoors and outdoors. Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces.</p>
    
    <h2>Cover Your Coughs and Sneezes</h2>
    <p>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash and wash your hands immediately after.</p>
    
    <h2>Clean and Disinfect</h2>
    <p>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</p>
